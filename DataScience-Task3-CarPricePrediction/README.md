# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning | OIBSIP Task 3

## 📌 Objective
Predict the resale value of used cars based on historical market data (mileage, age, brand, fuel type, transmission, etc.) to help dealerships and buyers estimate fair market prices.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO
- **Records:** 4,340 raw listings (after cleaning)
- **Key Columns:** Car Name, Year, Selling Price, KM Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, Owner
- **Target Variable:** Selling Price (₹)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate records
- Detected and capped outliers using IQR method on `selling_price` and `km_driven`
- Maximum selling price capped to ~₹1.2M, extreme-high-mileage cars bounded
- Distribution shifts confirmed via before/after density plots

### Selling Price Distribution (After Outlier Treatment)

### KM Driven Distribution

### Outlier Detection — Box Plots

---

## 🔧 Feature Engineering
- **Brand extraction:** Extracted manufacturer brand from car name column
- **Car age calculation:** Derived `car_age` from the year column
- **Categorical encoding:** Applied encoding to Fuel Type, Transmission, Seller Type, and Owner columns

## 🔍 EDA — Key Findings

### Selling Price vs Car Age

### Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Matrix](images/Correlation%20Matrix.png)

**Key Observations:**
- **Newer cars** = **Higher price** — strong negative correlation between car age and price
- **Diesel cars** fetch **more money** than petrol equivalents
- **Automatic transmission** holds significantly more value in the resale market
- **Older cars** tend to have **more owners** and higher mileage

## 🤖 Models Trained

Three regression models were evaluated:

| Model | MAE | MSE | RMSE | R² |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 0.3276 | 0.2111 | 0.4594 | 0.6891 |
| Random Forest | **0.2848** | 0.1536 | 0.3919 | 0.7738 |
| **XGBoost** | 0.2877 | **0.1382** | **0.3715** | **0.7772** |

### Model Performance Comparison

## 🏆 Best Model: XGBoost

- **Highest R² Score:** 0.7772 — explains **77.72% of variance** in selling price
- **Lowest RMSE:** 0.3715
- **Lowest MSE:** 0.1382
- Selected as the final model based on superior overall predictive performance

### Top Feature Importances (XGBoost)
1. **Vehicle Age (15.7%)** — The single most dominant factor. Depreciation hits hardest.
2. **Brand: Toyota (12%)** — Market prices in a "reliability premium" for Toyota
3. **Transmission (11%)** — Automatic transmissions hold significantly more resale value

**Conclusion:** For a dealership or seller, sourcing newer, automatic Toyotas will yield the highest consistent resale margins.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **XGBoost outperforms** Linear Regression and Random Forest for used car price prediction
2. **Vehicle age is the #1 predictor** — depreciation dominates all other factors
3. **Toyota commands a brand premium** in the resale market (~12% feature importance)
4. **Automatic transmission** adds significant resale value over manual
5. **Outlier capping was essential** — raw data had extreme luxury vehicles skewing the distribution
